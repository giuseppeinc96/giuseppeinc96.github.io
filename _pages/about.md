My background as a high-performance judo athlete for 5 years instilled in me a disciplined approach, a growth mindset and exceptional time-management skills, which I apply to every professional endeavour.

Bringing a unique blend of technical prowess and business insight, my expertise spans essential technologies such as Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow and PyTorch, further complemented by my proficiency in advanced data visualisation tools like Tableau and PowerBI.

My professional journey began as a Business Analyst Apprentice at Intesa Sanpaolo Group in Milan, where I significantly improved risk assessment processes and data analysis efficiency, achieving a 20% reduction in operational risks.
