# Biography
I am a dynamic and proactive professional, deeply passionate about technology, business, and artificial intelligence. My background as a high-performance judo athlete for 5 years instilled in me a disciplined approach, a growth mindset and exceptional time-management skills, which I apply to every professional endeavour. As an innovative data scientist and analyst, I am driven by the opportunities at the intersection of data-driven insights and transformative technologies. My ambition is to catalyse business transformation and make a meaningful impact in today's rapidly evolving business landscape.

This commitment extends into my professional journey, where I have significantly enhanced business operations and profitability across diverse sectors, including finance, consulting, and hospitality. Bringing a unique blend of technical prowess and business insight, my expertise spans essential technologies such as Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow and PyTorch, further complemented by my proficiency in advanced data visualisation tools like Tableau and PowerBI.

My professional journey began as a Business Analyst Apprentice at Intesa Sanpaolo Group in Milan, where I improved risk assessment processes and data analysis efficiency, achieving a 21% reduction in operational risks for major investment portfolios. Progressing to a Junior Data Scientist role at Alkemy, I led data management initiatives for +200 startup companies and collaborated with the Marketing and Operations department to develop NLP-driven sentiment analysis models using LSTM neural networks. These models automatically analyzed customer sentiments from online reviews and social media, improving targeted customer engagement and satisfaction. Continuing my journey in the UK, I joined SOHO HOUSE in London, where I applied advanced statistical modelling techniques and analytics to  guide strategic updates to the F&B menu and optimised marketing campaigns. My efforts led to a 32% increase in seasonal sales. I have also developed a predictive churn model employing Recurrent Neural Networks, utilising member transaction data across all company branches, thus enabling effective proactive retention strategies that reduced churn by 26%

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have contributed to over 16 projects, where I applied my knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP), supervised and unsupervised learning methods, and a variety of data modelling techniques. My capabilities extend to statistical programming, data cleansing, validation, and the utilisation of sophisticated business intelligence tools.
